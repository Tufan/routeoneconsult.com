              <h3><strong>Andrew Lloyd Webber's Really Useful Group - Covent Garden WC1</strong></h3>
              <p><strong>Background</strong></p>
              <p>An existing client introduced Route One to Andrew Lloyd Webber's &lsquo;The Really Useful Group Limited' who required advice in respect of an office relocation and fit out. Following a successful pitch, Route One were appointed as Project Managers in respect of the new fit out across 8,000 sq ft of offices in Covent Garden.</p>
              <p><strong>Challenges</strong></p>
              <p>The key challenge of this project was managing late variations to the works which could not be allowed to impact on design, budget or programme. At each step Route One were required to co-ordinate between the incumbent designer and contractor to ensure variations to the initial specification did not detract from the initial design concept.</p>
              <p><strong>Outcome</strong></p>
              <p>RUG's new office environment is very different to that of the former premises, feedback is extremely positive and staff are embracing the change. The project was delivered on time and on budget and through focused management of the project Route One have been able to present the client with a workspace which exceeds expectations. The fact that the instruction came via an introduction from an existing client is particularly pleasing.</p>
              <p><strong>Client Testimonial</strong></p>
              <p>"<em>Route One understood the key drivers for our relocation to new office premises and the subsequent fit out. A move to radically different space required considerable change management to ensure a smooth transition and Route One's assistance, as Project Managers, was invaluable during this process.</em><em>Tim Brock exceeded our expectations of a dedicated Project Manager. Tim was fully engaged throughout the process and was particularly effective at incorporating variations to the works as they developed or were identified so that there was no impact on either programme or budget, both key requirements for us as a company. No query was too small to be answered and he was happy to get involved in matters that would not ordinarily come under the remit of a Project Manager.</em> <em>Route One were on board with RUG from day one, undertaking a survey of the new premises and providing dilapidations advice on our existing premises. The company appears to thrive on the challenges faced when undertaking complicated and demanding projects with a constant focus on the end result.</em>"<br />

              <h3><strong>HNG &ndash; London W1</strong></h3>
              <p><strong>Background</strong></p>
              <p>HNG, a respected multidisciplined chartered surveying practice in London&rsquo;s West end, instructed Route One to design and project manage the fit out of their new office premises close to Oxford Circus.</p>
              <p><strong>Challenges</strong></p>
              <p>Given the impending demolition of their existing offices timescales were of utmost importance to ensure minimal business disruption. The construction period was just 6 weeks. To complicate matters planning permission was required for the installation of air conditioning units on the roof. &nbsp;Liaising with the building management team throughout the contract was imperative given the occupied nature of this multi tenanted building.</p>
              <p><strong>Outcome</strong></p>
              <p>Through simple yet innovative design, Route One were able to deliver a contemporary office for this company of property professionals at a competitive cost making best use of space.</p>
              <p><strong>Client Testimonial</strong></p>
              <p><em>&ldquo;Given the pending demolition of our existing premises it was crucial for Route One to manage a seamless move to our new offices where timing was so important. They were able to provide HNG with a well designed office space, making the most of the constraints of the floor plate whilst maintaining team cohesion. The scheme was delivered on budget and on a tight time scale from initial concept to project delivery. &nbsp;We would be happy to recommend Route One as designers and project managers on other similar schemes&rdquo;</em><br />
