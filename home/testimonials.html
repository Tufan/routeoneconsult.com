              <h1>Testimonials</h1>
              <p>&quot;Route One understood the key drivers for our relocation to new office premises and the subsequent fit out. A move to radically different space required considerable change management to ensure a smooth transition and Route One's assistance, as Project Managers, was invaluable during this process. Tim Brock exceeded our expectations of a dedicated Project Manager. Tim was fully engaged throughout the process and was particularly effective at incorporating variations to the works as they developed or were identified so that there was no impact on either programme or budget, both key requirements for us as a company. No query was too small to be answered and he was happy to get involved in matters that would not ordinarily come under the remit of a Project Manager. Route One were on board with RUG from day one, undertaking a survey of the new premises and providing dilapidations advice on our existing premises. The company appears to thrive on the challenges faced when undertaking complicated and demanding projects with a constant focus on the end result.&quot;<br />
              <strong>Barney Wragg - Managing Director, The Really Useful Group Ltd</strong></p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>&ldquo;Seven Publishing seek professionalism and reliability in the management of our fit out projects. Following the successful acquisition of Squared Publishing and the subsequent relocation to Sea Containers House, we retained Tim Brock as the lead Project Manager on the strength of previous projects he has completed on behalf of the Group.&nbsp;In this instance the project design needed to improve on the existing congested office environment and to open up the floor, increasing the natural light into the space. Tim&rsquo;s design successfully delivered extensive improvement to the area despite having to work within tight budgetary constraints. He has repeatedly demonstrated the ability to effect high impact solutions without breaking the budget balance.&nbsp;As a result of such projects we have learnt the importance of having overall budgetary control of the project, including furniture, IT and move management. Tim has a positive responsiveness to change and has the ability to incorporate the same within tight time and programme parameters.&nbsp;Tim&rsquo;s ability to successfully control and deliver all of our fit out projects over the past 6 years means we would not hesitate in recommending his services.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br />
              <strong>Mike Potter -&nbsp;Chairman Seven Publishing</strong></p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>&ldquo;Given the pending demolition of our existing premises it was crucial for Route One to manage a seamless move to our new offices where timing was so important. They were able to provide HNG with a well designed office space, making the most of the constraints of the floor plate whilst maintaining team cohesion. The scheme was delivered on budget and on a tight time scale from initial concept to project delivery. &nbsp;We would be happy to recommend Route One as designers and project managers on other similar schemes&rdquo;<br />
              <strong>Richard Spencer &ndash; HNG</strong></p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>&ldquo;We asked a lot of Route One in this instance due to timescale, and they responded extremely effectively and efficiently. It is important for investors such as ourselves in the current market to be able to rely on our external consultants to assist us with what we are trying to achieve &ndash; often with very tight deadlines. They delivered everything we asked of them in this case.&rdquo;<br />
              <strong>Gavin Ingram &ndash; LaSalle Investment Management</strong></p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>&ldquo;Over the past 4 years Route One have been able to deliver a quality and efficient service whilst advising on all general professional matters including pre-acquisition surveys, schedules of dilapidations and Party Wall matters. Their commercial approach helps the organisation plan for the future and assists in minimising risks. Route One are able to react immediately and provide value when it matters, both of which helps to ensure Jack Wills continues to operate efficiently and competitively in this challenging market.&rdquo;<br />
              <strong>Tom Johnston &ndash; Jack Wills</strong></p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>"Performance and early identification of potential liability, particularly with regards to property expenditure was key for IIED. Tim was able to provide significant comfort through his reporting and presenting of the liabilities particularly in respect of disposing of our existing properties and negotiating and minimising our exposure to dilapidations. &nbsp;Route One&rsquo;s ethical and sustainable approach to their operations was key in ensuring a workable partnership with IIED. I would not hesitate in recommending Route One to prospective clients requiring an organisation which is quick to react and provides a focused personal and quality service."<br />
